```

## Problem 1

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month_num = 1:12,
    month_abb = month.abb,
    month = month.name
  )

pols = 
  read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") |>
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month_num", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  mutate(
    president = recode(prez_gop, "0" = "dem", "1" = "gop", "2" = "gop")) |>
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, everything(), -day, -starts_with("prez")) 
```

We also clean the 538 `snp` data, which contains information related to
Standard & Poor’s stock market index.

``` r

snp = 
  read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv", col_types = cols(date = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y"), close = col_double())) |> #modified for correct date
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) |> #modified for correct date
  mutate(year = ifelse(year > 2023, year - 100,year)) |> #modified for correct date
  arrange(year, month) |>
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) |>
  select(year, month, close) 
```

Finally, we tidy the `unemployment` data so that it can be merged with
the `pols` and `snp` datasets.

``` r
unemployment = 
  read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") |>
  rename(year = Year) |>
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec, 
    names_to = "month_abb",
    values_to = "unemployment"
  ) |> 
  left_join(x = _, y = month_df) |> 
  select(year, month, unemployment)
```

Now we merge the three datasets!

``` r
data_538 = 
  left_join(pols, snp) |>
  left_join(x = _, y = unemployment)

str(data_538)
## tibble [822 × 13] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
##  $ year        : num [1:822] 1947 1947 1947 1947 1947 ...
##  $ month       : chr [1:822] "January" "February" "March" "April" ...
##  $ month_num   : int [1:822] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
##  $ gov_gop     : num [1:822] 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 ...
##  $ sen_gop     : num [1:822] 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 51 ...
##  $ rep_gop     : num [1:822] 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 253 ...
##  $ gov_dem     : num [1:822] 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 23 ...
##  $ sen_dem     : num [1:822] 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 45 ...
##  $ rep_dem     : num [1:822] 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 198 ...
##  $ president   : chr [1:822] "dem" "dem" "dem" "dem" ...
##  $ month_abb   : chr [1:822] "Jan" "Feb" "Mar" "Apr" ...
##  $ close       : num [1:822] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
##  $ unemployment: num [1:822] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...

write.csv(data_538, "data_538.csv", row.names=FALSE) #save the data into a csv file
```

Notice that there are some `NA` values in the `close` and `unemployment`
variables, which indicate that the value of these variables is missing
at those locations.

Let’s talk about the 538 datasets. The `pols` data has 822 observations
and 11 variables and tells us about the party affiliation distribution
(democrat or republican) for governors and senators for a given year
from years 1947 to 2015. It also tells us whether the sitting president
was a democrat or republican. The `snp` data has 787 observations and 3
variables, ranging from years 1950 to 2015. The `unemployment` data has
816 observations and 3 variables ranging from years 1948 to 2015. In
Januarys in or after 1975 in which a democrat was president, the average
unemployment rate was 6.57. The average unemployment rate over the same
time period in which a republican was president was 6.47.

## Problem 2

Firstly, I cleaned the Mr. TrashWheel, Professor TrashWheel, and Gwynnda
TrashWheel dataset.

``` r
Mr_TrashWheel = 
  read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", col_names = TRUE) |>
  select(c(1:14)) |> #ignore the column without data
  janitor::clean_names() |> #clean the dataset
  drop_na(dumpster) |> #remove data without dumpster number
  rename (volume = volume_cubic_yards) |>
  rename (weight = weight_tons) |>
  mutate (homes_powered, homes_powered = weight*500/30) |> #calculate number of homes powered
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) |>
  mutate(TrashWheel = "MrTrashWheel")
```

``` r
Prof_TrashWheel = 
  read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", col_names = TRUE) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> #clean the dataset
  drop_na(dumpster) |> #remove data without dumpster number
  rename (volume = volume_cubic_yards) |>
  rename (weight = weight_tons) |>
  mutate (homes_powered, homes_powered = weight*500/30) |> #calculate number of homes powered
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) |>
  mutate(TrashWheel = "ProfTrashWheel")
```

``` r
Gwynnda_TrashWheel = 
  read_excel("./data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", col_names = TRUE) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> #clean the dataset
  drop_na(dumpster) |> #remove data without dumpster number
  rename (volume = volume_cubic_yards) |>
  rename (weight = weight_tons) |>
  mutate (homes_powered, homes_powered = weight*500/30) |> #calculate number of homes powered
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))|>
  mutate(TrashWheel = "GwynndaTrashWheel")
```

Then, I merged those three datasets together.

``` r
TrashWheel_combined = bind_rows (Mr_TrashWheel,Prof_TrashWheel,Gwynnda_TrashWheel)

str(TrashWheel_combined)
## tibble [845 × 15] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
##  $ dumpster       : num [1:845] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
##  $ month          : chr [1:845] "May" "May" "May" "May" ...
##  $ year           : num [1:845] 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 ...
##  $ date           : POSIXct[1:845], format: "2014-05-16" "2014-05-16" ...
##  $ weight         : num [1:845] 4.31 2.74 3.45 3.1 4.06 2.71 1.91 3.7 2.52 3.76 ...
##  $ volume         : num [1:845] 18 13 15 15 18 13 8 16 14 18 ...
##  $ plastic_bottles: num [1:845] 1450 1120 2450 2380 980 1430 910 3580 2400 1340 ...
##  $ polystyrene    : num [1:845] 1820 1030 3100 2730 870 2140 1090 4310 2790 1730 ...
##  $ cigarette_butts: num [1:845] 126000 91000 105000 100000 120000 90000 56000 112000 98000 130000 ...
##  $ glass_bottles  : num [1:845] 72 42 50 52 72 46 32 58 49 75 ...
##  $ plastic_bags   : num [1:845] 584 496 1080 896 368 ...

##  $ TrashWheel     : chr [1:845] "MrTrashWheel" "MrTrashWheel" "MrTrashWheel" "MrTrashWheel" ...
```

The total number of observation after cleaning is 845, and the variables
of this dataset are dumpster, month, year, date, weight, volume,
plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles,
plastic_bags, wrappers, sports_balls, homes_powered, TrashWheel.

The dataset contains the trashes removed by the water-wheel vessel from
the Inner Harbor in Baltimore from 2014 to 2023. Three types of Trash
Wheel are included in this dataset: Mr. Trash Wheel, Professor Trash
Wheel, and Gwynnda Trash Wheel. The total weight of trashes collected by
those three trash wheels is 2543.01 tons.

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 216.26
tons.

The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021
is 16300.

## Problem 3

#### Baseline dataset

Firstly, I cleaned the baseline dataset.

``` r
baseline = 
  read_csv("./data/data_mci/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> #clean the dataset
  mutate (sex = ifelse(sex == 1, "Male", "Female")) |>
  mutate (apoe4 = ifelse(apoe4 == 1, "APOE4 carrier", "APOE4 non-carrier")) |>
  mutate (age_at_onset = as.numeric(age_at_onset))
## Warning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.
## ℹ In argument: `age_at_onset = as.numeric(age_at_onset)`.
## Caused by warning:
## ! NAs introduced by coercion
```

Then, I removed the participants who did not meet the inclusion
criteria, which is no MCI at the baseline.

``` r
baseline_clean = 
  baseline |>
  filter(age_at_onset > current_age | is.na(age_at_onset))
#only participants who develop MCI after the baseline and participants who never develop MCI are kept. 
```

In the baseline dataset, there are 483 participants recruited in this
study, and 479 participants meet the inclusion criteria.

Among all the participants who meet the criteria, there are 93
participants who develope MCI. The average baseline age is 65.03.

There are 29.86% of women in the study are APOE4 carriers.

#### Amyloid dataset

Firstly, I cleaned the amyloid dataset.

``` r
amyloid_clean = 
  read_csv("./data/data_mci/mci_amyloid.csv", skip = 1) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> #clean the dataset
  rename(id = study_id)
```

Then, I performed pivot for the amyloid dataset.

``` r
amyloid_pivot = 
  pivot_longer(amyloid_clean, col = !id, names_to = "time", values_to = "amyloid beta 42/40 ratio")
  
```

There are `NA` values in the `amyloid beta 42/40 ratio`, which means
there are missing values.

In total, there are 487 participants recruited in this study, and 487
participants meet the inclusion criteria for the amyloid dataset. The
variables evaluated are id, baseline, time_2, time_4, time_6, time_8.

#### Merge dataset

In the end, I combined the baseline and the amyloid dataset.

``` r
combined_full = 
  full_join(baseline,amyloid_clean, by = "id") #total participants in this study 

combined_clean_full = 
  full_join(baseline_clean,amyloid_clean, by = "id") #participants meet all criteria

combined_clean = 
  inner_join(baseline_clean,amyloid_clean, by = "id") #participants meet all criteria and appears in both dataset

combined_pivot = 
  inner_join(baseline_clean,amyloid_pivot, by = "id") #combine the dataset after pivot

str(combined_pivot)
## tibble [2,355 × 8] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
##  $ id                      : num [1:2355] 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 ...
##  $ current_age             : num [1:2355] 63.1 63.1 63.1 63.1 63.1 65.6 65.6 65.6 65.6 65.6 ...
##  $ sex                     : chr [1:2355] "Female" "Female" "Female" "Female" ...
##  $ education               : num [1:2355] 16 16 16 16 16 20 20 20 20 20 ...
##  $ apoe4                   : chr [1:2355] "APOE4 carrier" "APOE4 carrier" "APOE4 carrier" "APOE4 carrier" ...
##  $ age_at_onset            : num [1:2355] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
##  $ time                    : chr [1:2355] "baseline" "time_2" "time_4" "time_6" ...
##  $ amyloid beta 42/40 ratio: chr [1:2355] "0.1105487" NA "0.109325197" "0.104756131" ...
```

After cleaning the data, there are 495 participants who attended this
study who fullfilled the inclusion criteria. There are 16 participants
only appears in the amyloid dataset, and 8 participants only appears in
the baseline dataset.

After pivoting the amyloid dataset, the final dataset have 2355 rows and
8 columns.The variables considered in this dataset are id, current_age,
sex, education, apoe4, age_at_onset, time, amyloid beta 42/40 ratio.

After cleaning, there are 471 participatns appears in both dataset and
satisfied all inclusion criteria. Among those participants, there are
205 women and 266 men. The average age at baseline is 65.05.

``` r
write.csv(combined_pivot, "data/ mci_clean.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```
